## What

<!-- One or two sentences a user would understand. -->

## Why

<!-- Issue link, DESIGN.md section, or the incident/bug it addresses. -->

## Testing

<!-- Required. What you ran and what it showed. Behaviour changes need conformance fixtures. -->

- [ ] `scripts/ci/quality-gate.sh` passes locally
- [ ] Conformance fixtures added or updated for behaviour changes

## Security impact

<!-- Required. Does this change what an agent is allowed to do? New trust assumption,
     new I/O in a library crate, new dependency, new fail-open path? Write "none" if none. -->

## Release note

<!-- One line for CHANGELOG.md, written for users; or "none" for internal changes. -->
