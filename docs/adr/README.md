# Architecture decision records

Each ADR records one decision that constrains the code: context, decision,
consequences. Accepted ADRs are never edited; a later ADR supersedes, amends or
refines them. To add one, copy the shape of ADR-004 and take the next number.

| ADR | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [001](ADR-001-rust-for-the-kernel.md) | Rust for every kernel crate; TypeScript and Python only for userland SDKs and host plugins | accepted |
| [002](ADR-002-deny-is-absolute.md) | Evaluation is `deny → allow → ask → defaults`; allow never overrides deny; kind-wide denial is a per-kind default; strictest wins across atoms | accepted |
| [003](ADR-003-decide-and-enforce.md) | The parser is not the security boundary; OS enforcement, an egress proxy and session taint are the answer | accepted; release timing superseded by ADR-013 |
| [004](ADR-004-exit-code-contract.md) | Exit codes: 0 allow/ask/ok, 2 deny, 3 unresolved ask, 64 usage or configuration error | accepted; amended by ADR-015 |
| [005](ADR-005-own-posix-lexer.md) | An own POSIX lexer and classifier in `openmoat-core`; inline interpreter code is scanned, not parsed; anything unclear is `unparseable` (ask) | accepted |
| [006](ADR-006-policy-lock-integrity.md) | `policy.lock` pins policy, approval, environment and hook files by location, symlink-aware; drift denies everything until a person re-pins | accepted |
| [007](ADR-007-approvals-overlay.md) | `moat allow`: exact-text session grants in `approvals.json`, permanent rules in the pinned `policy.d/approved.yaml` overlay | accepted |
| [008](ADR-008-program-resolver.md) | Executable pinning through a CLI-supplied `ProgramResolver` over the search path recorded at `moat init` | accepted |
| [009](ADR-009-path-resolver.md) | Paths are checked literally and symlink-resolved through a CLI-supplied `PathResolver`; strictest wins | accepted |
| [010](ADR-010-shell-pattern-end-anchor.md) | A trailing bare `$` anchors the end of a shell pattern; the `env-dump` deny group uses it | accepted |
| [011](ADR-011-pty-wrappers-are-kernel-self.md) | `script`, `expect` and `unbuffer` around `moat allow\|doctor\|init\|policy` are denied by `kernel-self` | accepted; refines ADR-007 |
| [012](ADR-012-shell-pattern-exclusions.md) | `!` exclusions in shell pattern lists; `dev-shell` excludes options that run programs or write files | accepted |
| [013](ADR-013-alpha-decides-beta-enforces.md) | Alpha releases decide only and say so; enforcement gates beta; the benchmark gates 1.0 | accepted; supersedes the release clause of ADR-003 |
| [014](ADR-014-more-pty-wrappers-are-kernel-self.md) | More pseudo-terminal routes to `moat` (absolute `script`/`expect`, Python `pty.spawn`, `tmux`, `screen`, `osascript`) are denied | accepted; refines ADR-011 |
| [015](ADR-015-guard-usage-errors-deny.md) | `moat guard` exits 2 (deny) when it cannot parse its own arguments | accepted; amends ADR-004 |
| [016](ADR-016-stable-hook-binary-path.md) | Hooks and the lock record the stable install path of `moat`; `doctor` names a missing or different hook binary | accepted; refines ADR-006 |
| [017](ADR-017-fetch-kind.md) | `fetch`, a narrower kind of `net` for a host's own read-only fetch tool (`WebFetch`); the default asks for unlisted hosts | accepted |
| [018](ADR-018-enforcement-approach.md) | Enforcement tiers: Standard (the host's own sandbox, generated and pinned by OpenMoat), Isolated (container or VM with OpenMoat outside), Lightweight (generated Seatbelt or Landlock); Seatbelt does not nest | accepted |
| [019](ADR-019-one-policy-compiled-to-every-enforcement-point.md) | One policy compiled to every enforcement point through one IR; lossy targets narrow, never widen; differential executing tests prove the layers agree | accepted |
| [020](ADR-020-egress-proxy-and-secrets-broker.md) | `moat proxy` is the only network exit; the secrets broker injects credentials so the agent never holds them; minimal session taint | accepted |
| [021](ADR-021-os-layer-allowances.md) | An OS layer may be wider than the hook only by listed allowances: `sandbox.read_roots` and what a host needs to run, each printed by `moat sandbox show` | accepted |
| [022](ADR-022-repository-policy-and-trust.md) | `<project>/.moat/policy.yaml` adds deny and ask rules by itself; its allow rules apply only after `moat trust` pins that exact file by hash; hook only | accepted |
| [023](ADR-023-isolated-tier-macos.md) | Isolated tier on macOS: a Linux guest booted through Apple's `containerization` toolchain; virtiofs mounts and vsock proxy relay; bubblewrap, Landlock and seccomp nest inside, as on Linux | accepted; refines ADR-018 for macOS |

## Names in older ADRs

ADRs written before 2026-10-07 call the product "moat" or "agentmoat" and its crates
`moat-*` in `crates/moat-*`. Today the product is OpenMoat, its crates are
`openmoat-*` in `crates/openmoat-*`, and the command is still `moat`.

## References to retired documents

Older ADRs cite documents that were folded into the current set. Read them as:

| Cited as | Now |
|---|---|
| `DESIGN.md` §3 (threat model, T1–T12), §9 (G1–G12) | [THREAT_MODEL.md](../THREAT_MODEL.md) |
| `DESIGN.md` §4–5, §7 (hooks, components, pipeline, paths) | [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| `DESIGN.md` §6 (policy semantics) | [POLICY.md](../POLICY.md) |
| `DESIGN.md` §8.3–8.4 (own approval prompt, Telegram) | not built, and no issue |
| `STRENGTH.md` §3.3 (benchmark gate), `PROGRESS.md` §4 | [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and issue #144 |
| `STRENGTH.md` W6 (prompt fatigue), §4.1 (fuzzing, differential testing) | [THREAT_MODEL.md](../THREAT_MODEL.md) §5–6 |
| `TECH_STACK.md` | ADR-001 (the full scored comparison is in git history) |

Some ADR consequences describe gaps that later work closed: ADR-008's note that
`moat policy check` has no environment snapshot and that Windows ignores `PATHEXT`,
and ADR-017's note that no default `net` deny covers link-local addresses (the
`cloud-metadata` group does now). [POLICY.md](../POLICY.md) describes current
behaviour.
