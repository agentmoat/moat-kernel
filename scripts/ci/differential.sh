# The full differential suite (ADR-019, issue #170): every scenario in
# tests/differential/scenarios.yaml run against every enforcement point this
# machine has. `cargo test` alone runs the fast subset (the hook decision, and
# any host sandbox whose binary is already on PATH); this script also points the
# suite at the host binaries so the executing host-sandbox layers run too, the
# hostile project scripts of docs/EVIDENCE.md among them (#346). CI's
# `standard tier` job fetches pinned binaries with scripts/ci/host-binaries.sh.
#
# A layer whose binary is missing prints a visible "skipped" line and the suite
# still passes on the layers it can run, unless MOAT_REQUIRE_HOST_BINARIES is
# set (CI's `standard tier` job): then a missing binary fails the test. No step
# touches the network.

#   MOAT_CLAUDE_BIN  claude binary for the fake-API `claude -p` layer
#   MOAT_FAKE_API    python3 for the fake Anthropic API the claude layer needs
