# SSH key. OpenMoat blocks it under one policy and the audit trail shows what happened.

# Everything runs in a throwaway HOME that is deleted on exit. The agent-config
# variables are unset for every moat call, so your own ~/.moat, ~/.claude, ~/.codex
# and ~/.cursor are never read or written. Nothing is sent over the network; the
# tool calls are fed to `moat guard` exactly as Claude Code and Codex send them.

# Usage: scripts/demo/launch-demo.sh [path/to/moat]
