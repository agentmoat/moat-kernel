//! `openmoat-core`: the trusted decision core of OpenMoat.
//!
//! This crate is **pure**: it performs no I/O and makes no OS calls. Callers
//! (the CLI, host adapters) read files, resolve the environment and pass
//! everything in. That keeps the security-relevant logic small, testable and
//! portable (it also builds for `wasm32`).
//!
//! Pipeline: an [`Action`] is classified into [`AtomicAction`]s, each atomic
//! action is evaluated `deny → allow → ask → defaults` by a [`CompiledPolicy`],
//! and the strictest verdict across them becomes the [`Decision`]. Facts that
//! need the filesystem reach the engine through [`ProgramResolver`] and
//! [`PathResolver`]. The policy compiler ([`ir::lower()`]) derives from the same
//! policy what an operating-system layer can enforce (ADR-019).

#![warn(missing_docs)]
// A library reports to its caller; only the `moat` binary prints.
#![warn(clippy::print_stdout, clippy::print_stderr)]
