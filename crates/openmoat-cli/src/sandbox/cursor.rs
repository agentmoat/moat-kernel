//! Cursor backend: `sandbox.json` in Cursor's user directory (ADR-018).
//!
//! Key names are those of Cursor 3.23's `sandbox.json` reference
//! (<https://cursor.com/docs/reference/sandbox>) and Run Modes page
//! (<https://cursor.com/docs/agent/security/run-modes>). Cursor sandboxes the
//! terminal commands its agent runs; file tools stay with the hook. What the
//! generator relies on, as documented (not yet checked against a Cursor build):
//! - `type: "workspace_readwrite"` lets commands read and write the workspace and
//!   the temp directory; `additionalReadwritePaths` adds paths;
//! - `readBoundary: "workspace"` limits sandboxed reads to the workspace,
//!   `additionalReadPaths` and the system paths tools need (libraries,
//!   toolchains, certificate stores), and of `~/.ssh` only `known_hosts`;
//! - no key denies a path, so nothing can be closed inside a granted one: a
//!   grant with a denied path below it is left out, and what the policy denies
//!   inside the workspace stays open to sandboxed commands;
//! - `networkPolicy` allows only the listed domains when `default` is `deny`,
//!   `deny` wins over `allow`, and private and metadata addresses are blocked;
//! - a project's own `.cursor/sandbox.json` replaces `readBoundary` and
//!   `additionalReadPaths` and adds to the paths and network allowlist.
