//! Claude Code backend: the `sandbox` block of the user settings (ADR-018).
//!
//! Key names are those of Claude Code 2.1.290's settings schema. Its sandbox
//! covers `Bash`, `PowerShell` and `Monitor`; file and web tools run outside it
//! and stay with the hook. What the generator relies on, verified on macOS:
//! - a relative path in user settings resolves against `~/.claude`, so every
//!   pattern is made absolute (`**/.env` becomes `/**/.env`);
//! - a directory in `denyWrite` covers its whole subtree;
//! - `allowRead` re-opens what it names inside a `denyRead` region, but not a
//!   `denyRead` entry below it (`~/.cargo` leaves `~/.cargo/credentials.toml`
//!   denied), and a `**/` exception re-opens it everywhere;
//! - `permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories` denies sandboxed reads
//!   under the user directories (`/Users`, `/home`, `/Volumes`, …) outside the
//!   working directories, and makes file tools refuse them;
//! - with `network.httpProxyPort` and `network.socksProxyPort` set (only when
//!   the policy sets `sandbox.proxy_port`), sandboxed commands reach the
//!   network only through those loopback ports (2.1.292; the sandboxing docs,
//!   "Custom proxy configuration"), so with nothing listening they have none.
//!
//! On Linux bubblewrap mounts concrete paths, so the sandbox runtime expands a
//! `denyRead` glob from its literal leading directory when each command starts
//! and skips one that has none, such as `/**/.env` (`@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`,
//! "Glob pattern has no literal directory to start from"). A `Read(…)` deny
//! rule is added to `denyRead` relative to the session's working directory
//! (the settings reference: Read deny rules are merged into the sandbox; a
//! relative path resolves against the current directory), so each `/**/…`
//! read deny is also written as `Read(./**/…)`.
//!
//! Write lists get no expansion: the runtime drops every `denyWrite` entry that
//! still has a glob once a trailing `/**` is removed ("Skipping glob write
//! pattern on Linux"), `Edit(…)` deny rules included, which Claude Code merges
//! into `denyWrite`. A rule without a glob survives and resolves against the
//! working directory like a `Read` rule, so a `/**/<name>` write deny is also
//! written as `Edit(./<name>)`. Bubblewrap mounts a missing deny path's first
//! missing component read-only, so only a name directly in the working
//! directory gets a rule: `Edit(./bin/moat)` would make a missing `bin` read-only.
