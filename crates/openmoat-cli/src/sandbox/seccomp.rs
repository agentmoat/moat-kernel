//! Lightweight tier on Linux: the sockets the agent may create, for the
//! seccomp filter `moat run` applies after the Landlock rules ([`super::landlock`]),
//! which restrict files and TCP only.
//!
//! The agent may create TCP sockets over IPv4 or IPv6, whose connections
//! Landlock limits to the proxy's port. Every other `socket()` call fails with
//! `EPERM`: Unix sockets (the user's D-Bus session bus, nscd,
//! systemd-resolved), netlink, packet, raw, UDP, SCTP and MPTCP. So name
//! resolution works only through the proxy, as on macOS: a tool that ignores
//! `HTTP(S)_PROXY` cannot resolve names. `socketpair()` stays allowed: its Unix
//! sockets are connected only to each other, and Node uses them for the pipes
//! of the processes it starts.
