//! Platforms without a `moat proxy` service story yet. Windows is here:
//! Standard-tier proxy routing is not planned for the first release (#272),
//! so `moat proxy install` on Windows refuses with a clear message and the
//! user still has `moat proxy` to run the proxy in a terminal themselves.
//! There is never a service to report on or restart, so the stub has no
//! state: `moat proxy status` refuses, `moat doctor` and `moat sandbox sync`
//! say nothing about a service (`commands/proxy.rs`).
