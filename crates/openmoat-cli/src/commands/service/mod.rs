//! User-level service installation for `moat proxy` (ADR-020, #272).
//!
//! `moat proxy install` writes a launchd user agent (macOS) or a systemd user
//! unit (Linux) that keeps `moat proxy` running under the current user, with
//! `MOAT_HOME` set to the directory `moat` found this run; `moat proxy
//! uninstall` removes it; `moat proxy status` and `moat doctor` report its
//! state. Windows is refused for now (#272 defers Standard-tier proxy routing).
//!
//! A lock-drift exit from the proxy is deliberately an exit, not a
//! loop-restart: launchd's `KeepAlive = {SuccessfulExit=false}` and systemd's
//! `Restart=on-failure` leave a clean exit alone, so `moat doctor` can surface
//! the drift to a person instead of hammering the audit log with crash events.
//!
//! The service file goes next to the host's own unit directory with owner-only
//! permissions (`0o600` on Linux; launchd keeps `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
//! private to the user); `MOAT_HOME` is a path, never a secret, and token
//! environment variables are read from the broker at run time, never written
//! into the plist or unit.

// The plist and unit emitters are pure string functions. Each one is used
// only by its own platform (`macos.rs`, `linux.rs`), so a cross-platform
// build sees the other as unused; the `cfg` gating keeps the warnings away
// without turning off `-D warnings`.
