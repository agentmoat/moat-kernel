# openmoat (binary: `moat`)

The command-line tool of [OpenMoat](https://github.com/crocodile-labs/openmoat):
it checks the tool calls Claude Code, Codex and Cursor report through their hooks
against one policy (allow, ask or deny), configures those agents' own sandboxes from
that policy, and keeps a local, tamper-evident audit log. This crate owns all I/O: files,
environment, terminal, host configuration. Decisions come from `openmoat-core`.

```bash
cargo install openmoat --locked
moat init      # policy, lock, audit log; asks before setting up each agent it finds
moat status
```

[project README](https://github.com/crocodile-labs/openmoat#readme).

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `moat` | which agents are protected, today's decisions; answer a drifted policy or the last ask (terminal only) |
| `moat init [--hosts …] [--yes] [--dry-run]` | create `~/.moat`, write the default policy, create the audit log, install hooks idempotently, configure the host sandboxes |
| `moat uninstall [--hosts …] [--purge]` | remove the hooks and sandbox settings, restoring the backups (terminal only) |
| `moat status` · `moat doctor [--accept]` | installation health and each agent's protection level (exit 64 when unhealthy) · verify and re-pin (terminal only) |
| `moat show [<id> \| --session <id> \| --since … \| --recent N]` | inspect audit events |
| `moat replay` · `moat report` | per-session timeline · verdict totals, hosts, top rules, asks per active hour |
| `moat audit export \| verify \| report` | export the log as JSON Lines with chain hashes, verify an export, report over several machines |
| `moat allow [--last \| <command> --host … --session …] [--always]` | grant one command to a session, or add a permanent allow rule (terminal only) |
| `moat allow --site <host> \| --dir <path> \| --remove <id>` · `moat edit` | allow a site or a directory, or take such a rule out · edit the policy with a diff before applying (terminal only) |
| `moat trust [<repo>] [--revoke]` | let a repository's `.moat/policy.yaml` allow, until the file changes (terminal only) |
| `moat policy lint \| check \| compile` | validate a policy · explain a decision · print what OS layers enforce |
| `moat sandbox show \| sync` | the host sandbox settings the policy compiles to · write and re-pin them |
| `moat run [--write PATH]… -- <agent> [args]` | run an agent in a sandbox generated from the policy (macOS, Linux) |
| `moat proxy [--listen 127.0.0.1:<port>]` | run the default-deny egress proxy |
| `moat guard --host <id>` | hook entry point: payload on stdin, decision on stdout; fail-closed |

Exit codes are a contract (ADR-004): 0 allow/ok, 1 the agent `moat run` started
exited non-zero, 2 deny, 3 unresolved ask, 64 usage or configuration error.

Environment: `MOAT_HOME` (state directory, default `~/.moat`), `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`,
`CODEX_HOME`, `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` (host configuration directories).
