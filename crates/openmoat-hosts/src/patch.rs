//! Files named by a Codex `apply_patch` envelope.
//!
//! ```text
//! *** Begin Patch
//! *** Add File: path        (create)
//! *** Update File: path     (edit; may be followed by `*** Move to: other`)
//! *** Delete File: path
//! *** End Patch
//! ```
//!
//! Every named path is written (a delete or a move removes its source). A
//! patch that names no file is passed on empty and decided as unparseable.
//!
//! Codex trims a file header before matching it, so ` *** Delete File: x`
//! after an added file's lines is a header to it. A line is matched the same
//! way here, ignoring case as well, and wherever it appears: naming a file the
//! patch does not touch only makes the decision stricter, while missing one
//! that Codex writes would let it through unchecked.
