//! The hash chain over audit events: canonical encoding, hashing and verification.
//!
//! Each event stores `prev_hash` (the `hash` of the event before it) and `hash`,
//! the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the event's canonical encoding (below). Editing,
//! deleting or reordering an event in the middle of the log breaks a link that
//! [`Store::verify_chain`] reports. The chain is unkeyed: someone who can write
//! the file can recompute every hash after an edit, and deleting the newest
//! events leaves a valid shorter chain. Detecting either needs the head hash
//! recorded outside the file (`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`).
//!
//! # Canonical encoding, version 1
//!
//! The concatenation, in this order, of:
//!
//! 1. the domain tag `moat-audit-chain-v1` as a string;
//! 2. `id`, `ts_ms` as integers;
//! 3. `host`, `session_id` as strings;
//! 4. `call_id`, `cwd` as optional strings;
//! 5. `tool`, `action`, `verdict`, `rules`, `reasons` as strings: the cells exactly
//!    as stored, so `action`, `rules` and `reasons` are their redacted JSON text;
//! 6. `latency_us` as an integer;
//! 7. `prev_hash` as a string.
//!
//! An integer is 8 bytes, big-endian two's complement. A string is its UTF-8 length
//! as 8 bytes big-endian, then its bytes. An optional string is the byte `0x00`
//! when absent, or `0x01` followed by the string. Length prefixes make the encoding
//! unambiguous; hashing stored cells rather than re-serialised values keeps it
//! independent of how a later build serialises an `Action`.
//!
//! The first chained event's `prev_hash` is [`GENESIS`]. A change to this encoding
//! needs a new domain tag; events already written keep verifying under v1.
