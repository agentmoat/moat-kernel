//! `moat-proxy`: the default-deny egress proxy behind `moat proxy` (ADR-020).
//!
//! It serves HTTP `CONNECT` tunnels and absolute-form plain-HTTP requests on a
//! loopback port:
//!
//! - Hosts are decided by moat-core's [`CompiledPolicy`](moat_core::CompiledPolicy)
//!   as `moat guard` decides a fetch tool's URL: only an `allow` passes.
//! - Cloud metadata and link-local addresses are refused whatever the policy
//!   says, by name and on every address the proxy resolves. Private and CGNAT
//!   addresses are refused unless an allow rule names the address.
//! - A tunnel's TLS `ClientHello` must name the CONNECT host (SNI); nothing is
//!   decrypted.
//! - A request that carries a brokered secret's placeholder or value to a host
//!   other than the secret's own is refused ([`Broker`]).
//! - Every decision is recorded through a [`Recorder`]; a failed record is a
//!   refused connection.
//!
//! Plain `std::net` and one thread per connection, capped by [`Limits`]; the
//! choice is explained in `docs/notes/proxy-evaluation.md`.
