//! The repository policy of a session's project (ADR-022): found, read and

//!
//! The file is attacker-controlled input. One that exists but cannot be read
//! or parsed is an error, so `guard` denies with `kernel-error` rather than
//! dropping the team's deny rules. Its allow rules apply only while the file
//! is the one a person accepted with `moat trust`.
