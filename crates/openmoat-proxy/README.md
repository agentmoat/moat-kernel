# openmoat-proxy

The default-deny egress proxy behind `moat proxy` and `moat run` (ADR-020).

It serves HTTP `CONNECT` tunnels and absolute-form plain-HTTP requests on a loopback
port:

- Hosts are decided by `openmoat-core` the way `moat guard` decides a fetch tool's
  URL: only an `allow` passes.
- Cloud metadata and link-local addresses are refused whatever the policy says, by
  name and on every address the proxy resolves. Private and CGNAT addresses are
  refused unless an allow rule names the address.
- A tunnel's TLS `ClientHello` must name the CONNECT host (SNI). Nothing is decrypted.
- A request that carries a brokered secret's placeholder or value to a host other
  than the secret's own is refused (`Broker`).
- Every decision is recorded through a `Recorder`; a connection that cannot be
  recorded is refused.

Plain `std::net` and one thread per connection, capped by `Limits`; no async runtime
and no storage. Part of [OpenMoat](https://github.com/crocodile-labs/openmoat).
